Hi my name is Amy, I'm a sophomore in CS at the University of Maryland. Outside of school I love to read. On breaks most of the time I curl up with a good book and tea and spend my afternoons that way. When I'm in school I love to go on the Metro and explore Washington D.C. and all of the neighborhoods that make up the city. I've recently gotten into theater in DC. And I love to go to different productions that are happening in different parts of the city. I chose Computer Science because I loved my first Computer Science class in college. And then as I got more into it I realized there were all of these cool ideas about how to organize lists and how to structure data that I just really enjoyed doing. Now I am doing research for a professor in the department named Dr. Golbeck. So we are studying passwords and passwords users remember, passwords users don't remember. And seeing if we can learn more about what will help people remember the hundreds of passwords they have to make for different sites. This summer I was also an intern for the US Airforce in Dayton, OH. And there with a team I developed an Android application that brought up a Google map and then you were able to draw on the map and an XB radio would send the map locations to a Rover and then a Rover would be able to follow the path you drew on an android application. And hopefully this will get more students into CS because we are going to have that application implemented by area high school students. And then, I am not quite sure what I want to do with CS when I grow up, but I do know that I want to use CS to understand more about people and the data they generate. Bye!
