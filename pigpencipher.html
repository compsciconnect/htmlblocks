<h1> The Pigpen / Freemason's Cipher </h1>

<h2> Explanation & History </h2>
<p>A little history on the Pigpen cipher from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher">Wikipedia</a>:<blockquote cite=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher">
The exact origin of the cipher is uncertain, but records of this system have been found which go back to at least the 18th century. Variations of this cipher were used by both the Rosicrucian brotherhood and the Freemasons, though the latter used it so often that the system is frequently called the Freemason's cipher.</blockquote> </p>
<p>The pigpen cipher is a substitution cipher. Another example of a substitution cipher is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Cesar Cipher</a></p>
