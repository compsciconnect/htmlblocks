Hi I’m Aboli I’m a junior at the University of Maryland and I’m studying computer science. Outside of school I love to bake and knit and watch crime dramas, its actually a problem, I love crime dramas. And I’ve actually recently been really enjoying hackathons at different schools where basically you go out with a group of your friends and program a project in 24 hours or 36 hours and make something really cool and use different websites like Twitter or Facebook in your stuff and submit it for prizes. And, I’ve never won anything, but, maybe I will soon, and I think they’re really fun. I chose computer science because of an HTML class I took in 8th grade, where I basically coded up a website and it was the prettiest thing I’d ever seen and I really fell in love with it. And my mom reminded me about how much I loved that class before I went off to college and I signed up for computer science because I thought I would really enjoy it, and I do, because its SO fun. Right now, like right now, right now, I’m knitting, see this, um but in school I am basically working for the astronomy department making apps to demonstrate astronomical principles like dark matter and galaxies and stuff, um and I am also trying to develop my website but that’s going a little slowly. This summer I am interning at Factset Research Systems up in Connecticut and I can’t explain how excited I am because I am going to be with some of my friends and picking my own project to work on and I will be working on something that I really love and I cannot wait. In the future, with CS, I really want to be at a place where I can work at my own pace and have a lot of fun doing what I do. Thanks it was nice talking to you!
