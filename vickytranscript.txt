Hi everyone my name is Vicky Lai and I’m currently a senior at University of Maryland in Computer Science and Economics. Outside of school I really love to ballroom dance, so that’s dances like waltz cha cha tango rumba, and its actually surprisingly common for computer science people to take on ballroom dancing as a hobby. I also like to read and lately I’ve been watching a lot of BBC TV series like Dr. Who and Sherlock. And since I’m currently studying abroad in Singapore I’ve been seeing the sights and exploring Singapore and trying lots of different kinds of food here. I’m in computer science because in middle school I got interested in web design and that actually got me interested in programming, learning about databases and so on. And I stayed in computer science because I really love the logical problem solving that’s involved in it, and there’s so much to learn and theres kind of something for everyone. It’s really cool how I can integrate it with other disciplines I’m interested in such as law, economics and linguistics. Currently I am finishing up my last year here on exchange at Nanyang Technological University and after I graduate I will be moving to Silicon Valley and starting a job as a software developer for Palantir Technologies. They’re a company that does Big Data software that is used in many different industry. It’s used by government agencies and financial institutions for instance. So the way I’ve spent my summers is, I actually spent my summer doing social media research with a research group at the University of Maryland. And I’ve also interned at Google as part of Google + hangouts and this past summer I interned at Palantir where I developed plug-ins to analyze lots and lots of emails. My plans for the future: I will be working at Palantir supporting their mission, which is to help solve the world’s biggest problems. And basically I just want to keep building cool things using computer science.
