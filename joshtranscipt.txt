 Hi. So my name is Josh Rosenbaum and I am a computer engineer or a computer scientist depending on who you ask. Some of my hobbies are ultimate frisbee, martial arts, of which the most recent thing I’ve done is Judo, reading and jigsaw puzzles. I decided to become a Computer Engineer when I was in high school and I originally took a class and in the class every time we clicked a button on the screen which I had created, something else would happen: for instance a window would pop up or the text in the button would change. And I just thought that was cool. I changed my major within my first semester of college to become a computer engineer. And one of the most interesting things I think I did in college was this. And this just does various things, right now its keeping track of the time. And now its going to decrement and increment the time from 10. For instance, if I twist this little thing the time goes up or goes down. And I programmed everything on here this was just originally a green board. I think its pretty cool. Once I graduated from college I started working at a company called Cisco, specifically on a project called Snort. Snort is an open source intrusion detection and prevention system. Which is a really fancy way of saying we basically examine the internet traffic and if there is anything that shouldn’t be there like a worm, virus, or something trying to take your credit card information, we are going to take an action blocking that.  Our logo is a pig, looks like this, and has a really big nose because we’re a sniffer and we basically examine all of the traffic and if we find anything wrong, we’ll take a corrective action.
