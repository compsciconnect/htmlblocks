Hi my name is Isabella Cornado and I am a sophomore at the University of Maryland studying Computer Science. My interests outside of school are listening to music, playing video games, and watching movies with my friends. I chose computer science because my dad was a professor of Computer Science at the University of the Philippines and at the University of Wollongong in Australia. His interests have kind of inspired me to take it on as a career. 

What am I doing now? I’m working at the Maryland Center for Women in Computing where I volunteer to go to local middle schools to help get more girls interested in computer science. This summer I am working at Google and I will working on the Google team in Mountain View CA. In the past I have also worked summer camps where I’ve taught Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript to middle schoolers to help them get more interested as well. For computer science I plan to become a software engineer and see where that takes me. Thank you!
